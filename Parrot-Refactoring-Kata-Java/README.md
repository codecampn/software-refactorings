Parrot Refactoring Kata
====================================

## Fixing the Test
Run:

    mvn verify

doesn't work?! Try to fix the test using the "red-green" pattern.

## Refactoring
Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful and polymorphic you can make it.

I made a video about this kata: [From Hello Polly! to Polymorphism: Parrot Refactoring Code Kata is FUN](https://youtu.be/UxNEHKg_2eA).

To install dependencies:

    mvn verify

The project uses [JUnit](https://junit.org/).

To run the test:

    mvn test
